INTRODUCTION                                *recutils*

The set of commands below will be available whenever you edit a .rec file.

COMMANDS                                    *recutils-commands*

These commands operate on buffers so you don't have to pass them a filepath as an
argument (unless you want to run the command on a different file).

:Recsel {args}              Run recsel with the supplied arguments and display
                            the output in a |location-list| in the current
                            window.

:Recinf {args}              Run recinf with the supplied arguments and display
                            the output in a |location-list| in the current
                            window.

:Recfix {args}              Run recfix with the supplied arguments and display
                            the output in a |location-list| in the current
                            window.
                            If there are no syntax errors in the file then the
                            |location-list| will not open, otherwise you will be
                            able to navigate the list and jump to the syntax
                            errors directly.

:Rec2csv {args}             Run rec2csv with the supplied arguments and
                            display the output in a split horizontal buffer
                            in the current window.

:RecNextDescriptor          Jump to the next record descriptor.

:RecPreviousDescriptor      Jump to the previous record descriptor.

:RecPreviewDescriptor       Show the current record descriptor in a
                            |popup-window| / floating-window / |preview-window|.

MAPS                                        *recutils-maps*

These |recutils-commands| maps are available in the |recutils| buffers only.

<localleader>rf             Invokes `:Recfix --check` on the current buffer.
<localleader>rn             Populates the command line with :Recinf.
<localleader>rs             Populates the command line with :Recsel.
<localleader>rv             Populates the command line with :Rec2csv
<localleader>r]             Jump to the next record descriptor.
<localleader>r[             Jump to the previous record descriptor.
<localleader>r?             Show the current record descriptor in a
                            popup/floating/preview window.

The above maps can be disabled by setting the g:recutils_no_maps option.

AUTO COMPLETION                             *recutils-autocompletion*

Basic support for auto-completing record set properties is available (by using
C-x C-o while in insert mode).

It can be disabled by setting the g:recutils_no_autocompletion option.
